# zprint-std
Support distribution of experimental zprint-std versions.

This repository exists to hold experimental version of zprint-std, which is a version of zprint that follows some variant of the discussion of standard formatting rules.

Note that everything distributed here is totally experimental, which means:
 * It has been only slightly tested, and has no actual tests
 * It will probably never be fully released in the form you see here
